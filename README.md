A4Q2 ~ https://editor.p5js.org/gkehnstrom/sketches/2V9hQ2Zid

for this assignment i was tasked to draw a pattern with a loop in p5js. I chose to use stars in columns and rows of 8 but with everyother star being smaller so it has a difference. I chose to keep the same color for everything just for a cleaner look. This sketch I am proud of you could say becuase it looks clean and I completed the assignment in a timely manner.
